Assignment: “hello, graph world”
    
When software developers are starting to work in a new environment, they are encouraged to start with a simple “beachhead” program.

In this assignment, you’re asked to create the nodes and edges for a basic graph, such as the Krackhardt kite shown
below. (You’re welcome to substitute data of your own choosing).

You may use a package of your own choosing, such as iGraph or NetworkX, or…? Your code should be delivered in an
IPython notebook, and placed into GitHub. In your assignment link, please provide a link to your GitHub repository.
